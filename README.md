Group project for John Lemon's Haunted Jaunt

Group Members and Work:
Quinn-Rainen - Repo, project setup, Linear Interpolation integration
Erin Stone - 'Enemies Parts 1 and 2', Particle Effect integration
Globus-O'Harra - player movement, game environment
John Dencklau - 'The Camera, Ending the Game, Audio' & Dot Product integration

Dot product is used to detect the ball object as the player. The position and 
relative view of the player is used to determine whether the colorful ball 
object is detected. Please see referenced material for further details:

Linear interpolation (causes gradual movement and color change on ball object)

Particle effect (animates around the player)

The feedback for detecting the ball (dot product) is seen via the console log.
Ideally, this would instead allow the player to interact with the ball to add
it to a notional inventory, with a UI element (ball icon) now on screen.
